[00:04.08] For whom weeps the storm
[00:10.39] Her tears on our skin
[00:16.85] The days of our years gone
[00:24.20] Our souls soaked in sin
[00:29.61] These memories ache with the weight of tomorrow
[00:46.29] Who fights?
[00:52.81] Who flies?
[00:59.22] Who falls?
[01:04.22] 
[01:17.00] One brings shadow, one brings light
[01:21.83] Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
[01:26.55] Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
[01:30.30] Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
[01:34.62] One brings shadow, one brings light
[01:38.92] One dark future no one survives
[01:42.75] On their shadows, away we fly
[01:57.25] 
[01:51.32] The road that we walk
[01:55.56] Is lost in the flood
[01:59.70] Here proud angels bathe in
[02:04.39] Their wages of blood
[02:08.25] At this, the world's end, do we cast off tomorrow
[02:32.75] 
[02:26.28] One brings shadow, one brings light
[02:30.50] To this riddle all souls are tied
[02:34.65] Brief our moments, brazen and bright
[02:39.14] Forged in fury, tempered in ice
[02:43.34] Hindmost devils, early to rise
[02:47.24] Sing come twilight, sleep when they die
[02:51.54] Heaven's banquet leavened with lies
[02:56.18] Sating honor, envy, and pride
[03:00.24] One brings shadow, one brings light
[03:04.31] Run from the light
[03:13.31] 
[03:07.47] Authors of our fates
[03:08.92] Orchestrate our fall from grace
[03:10.92] Poorest players on the stage
[03:13.14] Our defiance drives us straight to the edge
[03:15.86] A reflection in the glass
[03:17.77] Recollections of our past
[03:19.89] Swift as darkness, cold as ash
[03:21.68] Far beyond this dream of paradise lost
[03:40.68] 
[03:24.22] Home
[03:27.72] Riding home
[03:31.98] Dying hope
[03:35.48] Hold on to hope, ohhh
[03:42.30] Home
[03:44.80] Riding home
[03:48.56] Home, riding home
[03:52.03] Hope, finding hope, ohhh
[04:04.03] 
[03:59.06] One brings shadow, one brings light
[04:03.02] One more chapter we've yet to write
[04:07.65] Want for nothing, nothing denied
[04:11.95] Wand'ring ended, futures aligned
[04:16.29] One brings shadow, one brings light
[04:20.27] One brings shadow, one brings light
[04:24.66] You are the light
[04:33.16] 
[05:35.97] We fall
[05:40.26] We fall
[05:44.02] We fall
[05:48.61] We fall unto the end
[05:55.95] One world's end
[05:59.84] Our world's end
[06:02.48] Our end
[06:05.85] We won't end
[06:11.85] 
[06:11.59] I am shadow, I am the light
